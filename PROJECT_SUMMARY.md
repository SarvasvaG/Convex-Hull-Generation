## 🚀 How to Use the Application

### Running the Application

**Option 1: Using Batch Files (Recommended for Windows)**

```bash
# First time only - Install dependencies
.\install.bat

# Start the development server
.\start-dev.bat
```

**Option 2: Using npm directly (requires fixing PowerShell policy)**

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Using the Visualization

1. **Generate Points:**

   - Enter number of points (3-100)
   - Click "Generate Points"

2. **Step Through Algorithm:**

   - Use the slider to see each step
   - Click "Play" for automatic animation
   - Use "Previous"/"Next" for manual control

3. **Understand the Display:**
   - Blue circles: Input points
   - Green circles with yellow border: Hull vertices
   - Green lines: Completed hull edges
   - Red dashed line: Current edge being formed

## 🧮 Algorithm Implementation

### Jarvis March (Gift Wrapping)

**Time Complexity:** O(nh)

- n = number of input points
- h = number of hull vertices

**Implementation Details:**

1. Find leftmost point as starting point
2. From current point, find most counterclockwise point
3. Add to hull and repeat until back at start
4. Record each step for visualization
